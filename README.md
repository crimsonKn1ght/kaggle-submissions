### Files for Titanic competition on Kaggle 🧑‍💻

I have written the above code in Jupyter notebook and I will keep updating the code from time to time.
If you are new to AI then this code might help you. 😎

This is an introductory competition so it is pretty basic in terms of coding..
I will try to keep updating this notebook on a daily basis so as to keep it as
updated as I can, in other words it's indirectly a sign of my progress.. 🚀
